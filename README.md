### Dependency Inversion Principle

You have to depend on abstractions, not on implementations.

Ability to replace injected dependencies.

Our dependencies must be done on interfaces / contracts or on abstract classes rather than on "concrete" classes.

Dependency injection provides a component with its dependencies, whether via a constructor, method calls, or property configuration.

Dependencies are separated by controlling and instantiating them elsewhere in the system.

Dependency injection allows us to inject only the dependencies we need, when we need them without having to write any dependencies.
